Hope that gacha games would, in the future, be allowed a second life with an offline version like this one. There's bunch of fun gachas I played in the past that has since been shelved and are unplayable outside (at times, sketchy) fan-made servers. Final Fantasy Record Keeper and Brave Frontier come to mind. How much i'd love to play those two with an official 'Offline' version with the gacha mechanics removed!<br><br>Ahem, now with that little tangent out of the way, MMX Dive Offline. I enjoy this game a lot. I never played the 'live' version in the past, but I am a big fan of Mega Man games, and being able to play as a lot of characters from across the franchise was of course a selling point for me. So I bought it. Installed it. And ended up playing 10 hours straight.<br><br>It plays a lot like Mega Man X games of the past, though a tiny bit clunkier. Your movement isn't AS smooth as it would be in MMX 1-3 for example. But it is definitely still playable. With a controller it is perfectly fine for me, and I was able to get into the flow of good ol' platforming goodness all over again. The auto aiming feature doesn't really bother me, the game is much faster paced than the ye olde games with a lot more enemies on the screen on average, and it feels balanced enough around the fact you have auto aiming (and you can turn it off anyway from the settings if it does bother you).<br><br>The gacha background is definitely noticeable though. Not all characters are equal, not by a country mile. Some event characters are almost hilariously broken, alongside with some choice characters you can get pretty much from the get-go that make a joke out of the main story. Same goes for the weapons. In a nutshell, if you want to go for efficiency and power over challenging yourself, don't bother with anything below S rank, from both characters and weapons. <br><br>This game has a lot of grinding. A lot. Of grinding. Even with gacha mechanics taken out and made so you will reasonably get everything unlocked, doesn't mean you get them easily though. Be prepared to grind grind grind the everloving s**t out of those event quests for XP items, money and parts because you need to put in the work to get anywhere. The story expects you to keep upgrading your stuff and characters, and the difficulty ramps up accordingly. To upgrade your character's star rankings, you need to buy their memories. Which costs money. 5000 zeni per memory for the aforementioned S-rank characters. And just to unlock the character, you need 40. So 200k just to have the character. And then you need to buy more memories to give them star ranks (up to 5) to unlock better passives for them. And the amount of memories you need goes up with every upgrade, up to 100 for the last rank. So 500k for the last rank alone. Hope you enjoy farming same quests over and over for money! Fortunately, I am a psychopath who enjoys grinding when it gives an actual sense of progression, so this is perfect for me.<br><br>If there's a major gripe I have with the game, it is that it can get a bit tedious. Excessive, even. To get to unlock most of the cast you need to progress the main story, and it is a significant chunk of stuff to do. I personally feel some of the most interesting characters and weapons unlock way, WAY too late into the story. Doing the actual levels can get pretty monotonous as well when you hit the sweet spot of having a good character with good weapons, since chances are you'll not be taking any damage and just insta-gibbing everything on the screen. Unless you don't, in which case you are probably the one getting insta-gibbed instead. MMX Dive Offline feels like the difficulty isn't really properly balanced, and its just a game of extremes where either you blitz through levels or can't make it past the first encounter.<br><br>Despite all of that, I still enjoy the game a lot. Its good fun, and it scratches that itch of good ol' platforming goodness. Actually inspired me to go back and replay the MMX games on the Legacy Collections again (good games btw, available on basically everything by now, go check them out!).<br><br>TL;DR: Fun game. Lots and LOTS of content. Even more grinding. Either extremely easy, or extremely difficult depending on whether you match the required power rating of a level or not. Would give it 8/10, perfect to jump in after a hard day of work and just brainlessly watch robots explode for a bit before going to bed.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLight minor spoilers throughout the review.<br><br>The original version of X Dive was completely terrible. Now, all of the gacha elements have been removed. Does that suddenly make it a good game, as, after all, there are several gacha games that if done the same and given a similar price tag would be great games loved by many (Genshin Impact and Arknights (to a lesser extent) come to mind)...? Ehh.....<br><br>X Dive is a celebration of Mega Man as a series created by a group that has never played a mega man game, or at least had too much corporate oversight controlling them. The parts that feel like they were made with some level of love for the series like the key art for the characters, animations for said characters, and the cards are all cool. However, like, this is still a Mega Man game right? The reason people play these games is the mixture of tight level design and top tier original boss fights, right? The characters are a great bonus and with a good story can really help (see: Zero series, ZX duology, Legends duology), but without great levels and boss fights you have an otherwise mediocre platformer, or at worst, X6.<br><br>This is... not worse than X6, but god, is it boring. We can categorize every single stage in one of three categories:<br>1) Run forward a bit, go into a room where you cant progress until all enemies are defeated (and often times these enemy gauntlet style challenges can feel weirdly slow if your gacha game rpg numbers are way higher than needed), defeat all enemies, continue until next enemy gauntlet, repeat until you get to the stage clear.<br>2) The previous category, but you have to wait for something to happen to progress as well. This can be an unskippable cutscene of an enemy dropping a bomb on something, you pressing a switch and the camera slowly panning to the thing you opened then slowly panning back to you, etc.<br>3) A straight hallway of some sort (horizontal classic Mega Man style, vertical through some elevator of some sort, or just a boss rush style teleporter room)<br><br>The amount of enemy gauntlets sprinkled throughout and the weird stop and go created by both that and the overall just tininess of every level (every level can be beaten in under 2 minutes. I would know, I have been speedrunning the hell out of the game as of late to fatten my <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fspeedrun.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\" >speedrun.com</a> page as a dumb joke) really kills any pacing. A majority of the length of most levels your first time through will also be spent going through the story.<br><br>I am going to assume you likely cannot speak or read Japanese or Cantonese (the dialect of Mandarin that Taiwan, Hong Kong, and parts of Southern China uses). If so, then you are stuck on a bad translation of the game. The story is completely incoherent as it is (I actually went through and read it all, including the events, which a decent chunk of which give a bit of supplementary material that is important to the plot Because Of Course) but the rough translation sure makes it even harder to attempt to go through. The story kills the pacing of the levels even more than everything within the levels wants to kill the pacing of the levels. The original characters X Dive presents range from laughably bad to the worst designs in the entire mega man franchise (Angepitoyeir... what the hell man. I feel creepy just looking at that character. Feels like pedo bait...).  It doesn't help out of the 6 original characters X Dive presents, only one is something you can fight! The rest either make you fight remakes of old Sigma fights throughout the series or just be something you have to protect (Rico.) The one you do actually get to fight is actually the best fight in the game, as it is the only original fight that also has a banger remix of one of the best tracks in the X series, so it does have that! There is a fascinating thing to note also that the last third of the game has a handful of worlds that only have 1 stage. This is because those used to be timed event exclusive levels... So at least I can say this version tries to fix the story a little bit (especially with the improved post credits scene that is cute and I like to think is a teaser for X9. The only reason I bought this was to help justify the existence of a X9 so I hope I am coping right)<br><br>On that note, the boss fights in general are bizarre. Even when playing on challenge mode, the bloated rpg stats and bloated gacha game weapons with 6 different modifiers and buffs (which that isnt even mentioning the variety of buffs and modifiers you can add to characters) make not a single one of the fights feel genuine. All of them, with the exception of exactly one (the final boss) are recreations of bosses throughout the X series (and the Yellow Devil, who based on the original Mega Man 1 version). The recreations are cool to see, as with the exception of the X1 bosses, anything from X2 - X6 has barely seen any 3d renderings so seeing things like Godkarmachine O'Inary from X3 (whose addition actually makes the game a 10/10 ignore the rest of the review), Gate from X6, etc who are all somewhat obscure picks. Even more somewhat obscure or at least really cool to see picks in the events too, like Omega from Zero 3 (who yes, is an event only fight instead of story, because why put one of the most iconic fights in the zero series when we can fight Overdrive Ostrich from X2 instead). However, they are just cheap recreations of old fights. These fights don't bring anything new to their fights and are largely the same as they were. These fights are all more fun in their original forms in their games as those didn't have overbloated health bars and damage numbers from all sides. You can kill almost every boss in the normal mode within a few shots with the right set up, and in challenge mode still fairly quickly with little thought. As it turns out, when you remove the gacha game mechanics from the gacha game, it becomes really easy to just get the overpowered characters, overpowered weapons, and overpowered armor. The only thing stopping you from spamming the EXP and armor grind events is your own patience. As such, if you are willing to put in at least a little time into it, you can make every stage really boring, every boss die in 1-2 hits, and everything starts to fall apart a little faster. The gacha game mechanics are still there. Even in challenge mode, you can still pretty easily break it (though not really much reason to, considering how underwhelming and unneeded the rewards are for playing challenge mode...)<br><br>So, it's a Mega Man game with bad boss fights, a bizarre and hard to follow story with a bad translation, a lackluster weapon system, terrible balancing, unnecessary amounts of rpg numbers throughout, menu bloat, bad and boring boss fights that are pale imitations of their original version, absolutely terrible level design that bores me to death, pretty good movement, and a bizarre selection of fanservice characters (many of which of course have your usual gacha game seasonal event variants, of course). <br><br>At least it's not X6, I guess. Don't spend 30 dollars on this. Get it for 10 dollars or under if you want it. Otherwise, just get the X legacy collection or literally any other game. 30XX came out recently and that game is phenomenal. Gravity Circuit too! Please please play those, those are actual love letters to Mega Man rather than this bizarre ex-gacha game.<br><br>EDIT: I probably should have mentioned that in the section in the boss fights there are fights against characters outside of the X Series besides Yellow Devil -- Just they are all in either the events or in the incredibly tedious and boring Jakob's Orbital Elevator levels (ie Drill Man and Dark Man 3 are Oribital Elevator exclusive. Arguably some of the best boss fights are event exclusive because it sure was a very mediocre gacha game before its online elements were removed. It's pretty odd! Omega from Zero 3 is an event only boss for example.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

franchise, the lack of original voice lines for existing characters, and the made-for-mobile-quality 3D models. I play other gacha games, after all. What I can't forgive is every image in the game being compressed and sandblasted with jpg artifacts. Even the opening title screen looks like trash. I'm glad it saved them several hours of file transfers during the porting process, but it drives me insane. I guess I should be thankful that it shocked me sober and I realized I spent $30 on this. It's a shame because I don't think offline ports of live service games are a bad idea, but I'm refunding this one without hesitation.\t\t\t\t\t<div

No, absolutely not.<br>Is <i>Mega Man X DiVE</i> a fun, fanservice-filled guilty pleasure for &quot;people&quot; such as myself who perhaps may have drank way too much from the funny-smelling Mega Man Kool-Aid bowl? Yes, absolutely.<br><br>I know most people will take a quick glance at this game and instantly dismiss it outright with a scornful, &quot;lol mobile game gacha trash,&quot; but I honestly think it's pretty cool that Capcom decided to publish a standalone, offline version of this game just for posterity's sake. I genuinely hope that other big gaming companies take note and follow suit once their own &quot;live service&quot; games have reached the inevitable end of their lifespans (offline versions of <i>NieR Re[in]carnation</i>, <i>Another Eden</i>, and <i>Mobius Final Fantasy</i> would be excellent candidates).<br><br>My only big complaint about this version is that it's missing all of the crossover/collab content from the online version. This means the <i>Street Fighter</i>, <i>Monster Hunter</i>, and <i>Devil May Cry</i> characters and weapons are all completely absent, which is a damn shame. The decision to remove this content from the offline version is completely baffling to me as Capcom fully owns the rights to these franchises, so I'm not sure what kind of legal mumbo jumbo is keeping them from including this content in this version.<br><br>Oh yeah, and the English translation is still the same machine-translated mess it was in the original. It's not that big of a deal as the story, dialogue, and original characters are all garbage, but I was still keeping my fingers crossed for a more professional English translation that didn't constantly border on total incomprehensibility. Oh well.<br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Also, what was up with that post-credits cliffhanger ending?</span></span>\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTL;DR - It is a fun experience that is a little rough around the edges and could use some polish and fixes. While not being a &quot;proper&quot; Megaman X game, it is nevertheless a good time and definitely a decent get, especially if you can grab it on sale.<br><br>What is there to be said about this game? Well, quite a lot, actually. I played the online version for a few months out of curiosity, and I can safely say that while both games are fun, this game gives you almost all of the content of the online version with none of the needless grinding and gacha nonsense. <br><br>The story is equal parts charming, annoying, fun, and ultimately forgettable. It is a somewhat fourth wall breaking affair in which you as the &quot;Player&quot; are entering cyberspace to fix corrupted data in the Mega Man series. You're accompanied by Navi... err... Rico, an EXTREMELY enthusiastic assistant; and later by a strange person named Via who appears to be a glitched-out bluish version of Zero; and finally Ico, who bears visual similarities to Rico but a different personality.<br><br>Let's make no mistake about it. This game's story is just plain dumb. It's silly, ridiculous, and not helped by some of the most atrocious Engrish I've seen in quite a few years. <br><br>However, with that being said, I admit that I just can't bring myself to dislike it. The characters are all unique and fun, and I'm especially fond of Via; whose gregarious and friendly personality belies some darker truths hidden within. Secrets that slowly become unraveled by the various boss enemies, who actually have a lot more dialogue than they did in the mobile version, and begin to go against the &quot;script,&quot; as it were. <br><br>One of my favorite interactions actually happens in the late game, when you meet<span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>Sigma. Which in and of itself is no surprise, but what is interesting is that the Sigma you meet is NOT the main antagonist (finally), but in fact the version of Sigma that existed before he was corrupted by the virus. I admit it was honestly kind of refreshing to see the gruff but dedicated reploid leader we've mostly only been given hints of apart from the dubiously-canon Maverick Hunter X. It was just a nice little twist that felt organic and fun without being over the top or silly.</span></span><br><br>In terms of the gameplay, it is very much your standard jump-and-shoot affair, in which you control your avatar - starting with X, but with practically every single major character in the Mega Man franchise being playable in one form or another - and travel through a couple dozen different worlds which are typically divided into 6 parts. Parts 3 and 6 usually contain a boss battle of some sort.<br><br>The first of the man ways this game diverges from the rest of the MMX series is the weapon interface. Rather than a single buster or saber and various subweapons, you have two weapons that you can swap between freely, as well as character-specific special moves and &quot;Dive Triggers,&quot; which are super attacks you can activate once per stage. Weapons have either a cooldown or limited ammo, so you're incentivized to switch your weaponry on the fly in order to prevent having to reload at the wrong moment.<br><br>There is a TON of variety in the weaponry, with lots of busters, blasters, sprayers, machine guns, and melee weapons to choose from, but one of the main issues is that there is almost no balance between any of them. Some weapons basically do all your work for you, while others are slow, clunky, and weak. you might purchase a super cool-looking S-Rank weapon only to find that it first 6 slow shots, has a super long reload time, and does less damage than an A or even B-Rank weapon of the same level.<br><br>My suggestion to fix this would be to have a character and/or weapon preview, so you can get a better idea of what the items do before sinking your resources into them.<br><br>And this IS a resource sink. When it comes to the gameplay, you really need to spent a lot of time leveling up your characters, weapons, dive triggers, armor, character cards, weapon spirits (I forget what those are called), and even your gallery. ALL of these things contribute to your character's overall power. If your character power is above the recommended level for each given stage, you should have an easy time getting through. If you're significantly lower than the recommended level, you start taking huge chunks of damage and doing a lot less in return.<br><br>In a nutshell, it's really clunky and takes a lot of time which you might prefer spending on blasting robots. This factor in and of itself could very well be a deal-breaker for you, so definitely keep this in mind.<br><br>So, let's talk about the controls. The GOOD news is that it allows direct input, which is always a huge bonus for me because I'd rather not fiddle with Xinput emulators/Joy2Key in order to use my preferred controller. I am deeply grateful when companies give a thought for d-input users in this day when Xinput is the standard.<br><br>In terms of converting touchscreen controls to physical buttons, I think it does just fine. I played the mobile version of the original on a Bluetooth controller, and of the two, the Offline version was even easier to set up.<br><br>However, there are a couple of major control issues with this game. Fortunately, these are issues that can both be fixed with updates, so I truly hope they will be.<br><br>First, the menu controls are *NOT* designed with the controller in mind. Being a former mobile game, the interface uses a mouse and keyboard, which is a huge no-no. And to be fair, you CAN use the controller in the menus; but all it does is control your mouse cursor, which can be needlessly clunky. And actual controller-friendly menu interface would be super valuable.<br><br>The second issue is arguably even bigger. I don't know if this has happened to other people, but for me personally, the game has never saved my control scheme. So every time I start the game again, I have to set all of my controls again, which is a needless headache. I don't know if this is a common issue, but it is one I've had, so I feel it's important to mention in case you have it as well.<br><br>In terms of controller support, I would also like a manual aim feature to be implemented if possible. Don't get me wrong; the auto-aim is extremely fluid and responsive. ...TOO fluid and responsive, in fact. The problem is that it's a system that was originally compensating for the flaws of a touchscreen control interface, so when you're playing on a physical controller, you almost feel like you've got a cheat code on, with the game doing a lot of your work for you.<br><br>Edit: This can be turned off in options. Thanks, SparkTFS!<br><br>Don't get me wrong. There is still a lot of fun and a passable amount of challenge to be had. But in this age of twin-stick controllers and even mouse-and-keyboard setups, having a manual aim option instead of auto-aim would be a HUGE bonus. Especially when you consider that the main factor in how difficult the game will be is what your power level is.<br><br>So, would I recommend this game? If you want a flawed but ultimately charming shooter with a lot of customization options, or if you're a big fan of the original Dive, this is a good way to go. If you want a more &quot;traditional&quot; Mega Man X experience, you might want to look into 20XX or 30XX instead.<br><br>What ultimately swayed my opinion firmly in this game's favor, however, is the fact that 10 or 20 years from now, we will still have an option to play it. This was a fairly decent online-only gacha game that was on death's door, but not only became rescued from permanent extinction by being brought offline, but became a much better experience overall because of it. I want to send a message to other game companies to show that we appreciate a game like this being given new life after its online run, so we can still play it in the future. Maybe one day a company like Square-Enix might follow suit and we'll get an offline version of Record Keeper. Who knows?\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('146472700',

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHere's the thing. I don't think this is an amazing Megaman X game. Fangames and megaman-inspired titles have been filling that niche since Capcom doesn't seem inclined to do it themselves. It's fun to just kind of turn your brain off and cruise through levels in a cloud of beam shots and saber slashes, but the movement's a bit janky and the levels are bland rehashes. The plot is also basically absent.<br><br>However.<br><br>X Dive Offline is worth supporting.<br><br>There's a lot of genuinely great writing and gameplay trapped in live service games that dies forever when the game ends. Making an offline conversion should be an easy cash in for the game's developer---but nobody does it. So this is a rare case of Capcom doing the right thing for game preservation, and I would really, really like it to succeed so that other live service titles follow suit.<br><br>For what it's worth, the offline conversion for X Dive is pretty decent. It doesn't *quite* support controllers in all menus, but the gacha system has been converted into a regular shop with higher tier characters and weapons locked behind game progression. Exp and resource awards are also tuned way up, so when you do hit a grind, that grind is farming an exp stage three times rather than farming it several hundred.<br><br>If you're looking for an actual continuation of the X series, Zero series, or Battle Network series, you're better served by checking out a megamanlike or a fangame. But if you want to pleasantly switch your mind off for a while, sample some busted characters, and Make Number Go Up, this absolutely scratches that itch.<br><br>Edit: Rolled credits. The writing is really the game's biggest drawback. There are live service games with incredible scripts, and there's plenty that start rough but improve tremendously when they hit their stride. XDive's is never good. Half the time it's extremely forced nostalgia (&quot;Hey player, you remember Flame Mammoth from the hit game Megaman X 1?&quot;), the other half of the time it's genuinely meaningless blather. Reading it feels like eating styrofoam. It does hit some interesting existential beats by the very end, but it doesn't have the chops to do anything with them. You could skip all dialog in the game and lose nothing.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a

manipulative practices and what do you have? A game that isn't fun the play, that makes Character and Power Progression a CHORE and BORING.<br><br>The ONLY thing this game has going for it, is a massive character roster that is relatively easy to access.<br><br>What will you do with those Characters? Not much, because the Game itself is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.<br><br>It's NOT Megaman X, Understand this.<br><br>If you go in thinking you're going to be getting an experience even remotely comparable to a Megaman X, prepare to be disappointed.<br><br>For one thing, minus the Power gatekeeping that is so common in these kinds of deplorable &quot;Phone Games&quot; in order to try to compel the player to buy worthless ♥♥♥♥ to &quot;Make numbers bigger&quot;... There really isn't any semblance of balance to speak of.<br><br>This game is AGONIZINGLY EASY, and you can and WILL become brokenly overpowered in no time flat. There is NO CHALLENGE.<br><br>But even that isn't the worst of it, because the levels are short, comically unforgivably short.<br><br>You will JUST start playing the game and the level you're playing will end. There's no way to get into a good &quot;flow state&quot; because the game is constantly ripping you out of the &quot;Game&quot; to go back to base where you would normally be compelled to spend money on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.<br><br>Credit where it's due, there is no freemium ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game anymore, you can get all the powerups and characters and whatnot by just playing the game... But... Why the hell would you want to? Because the game itself is boring as hell.<br><br>Phone games aren't just financially predatory and psychologically manipulative... They're also just bad games.<br><br>And this game is absolute proof of this.<br><br>Everything about playing this game is a chore... From upgrading your characters and weapons and chips and the 1,000,000 other things you have to upgrade (which in the OG game doubtlessly created multiple avenues to try to monetize bits to idiots). To starting a level only to be ripped out of it no less than TWO MINUTES later, to start this &quot;process&quot; all over again.<br><br>This game is dookie.<br><br>And it's sad because with the roster here and the variety of weapons and the like you'd think there'd be SOMETHING of worth. There isn't.<br><br>It's ALL FLASH and ZERO SUBSTANCE.<br><br>That roster, all those weapons, attached to a BETTER GAME, could have a made for one hell of a wild ride, but when the Game itself and the Gameplay loop itself is BAD, nothing else matters.<br><br>Far from simply not being worth your money, this game isn't even worth your TIME.<br><br>Avoid.\t\t\t\t\t<div
