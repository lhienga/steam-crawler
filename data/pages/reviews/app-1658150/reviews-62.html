class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo start, I have not beaten the game. TLDR; <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> this game should have been released as early access. please save your money. </span></span><br><br>The game feels underbaked. It has all the right ideas. However, it doesn't quite commit to nor develop any of them fully.<br><br><br><u>Creature Collecting</u><br>The main issue and why only about 7% of people that own the game have tamed 10 spirits (which is basically the equivalent of going on route 1 and catching 9 pidgey for a total of 10 pokemon.....really simple and easy) is because the game is not intuitive nor set up in a way that is accessible.<br>In order to tame more spirits than the 3 you can carry in your medallion, you have to LET GO on one of them, tame a level 5 spirit, turn that research into Zed, and the next day by mail he will send you a blueprint for a spirit barn where you can house more spirits. But there's a catch! It costs rare materials to make AND you have to farm out MORE materials in order to even use it once you have made it. You have to craft individual stalls within the barn to even get more spirits despite....spending a good chunk of materials to craft it in the first place? From what I have seen, this is one of the biggest qualms from the playerbase. It is why people put the game down after taming 3 spirits.<br>Essentially, the process of the....basis of the entire game....is clunky and not welcoming. <br><br>There's also big imbalance in typings. I believe there are at least more than 10 earth type spirits and water type spirits...but 3 ice type.... For whatever reason!<br><br><u>Dating Sim/Social Aspect</u><br>The characters are alright and easy to interact with. But the system in which you gain affection is...underwhelming. You have 4 options to interact with everyone: Chat, Joke, Flirt, and Gift. While gifting follows the traditional standard of games like Stardew Valley, the others are disappointing. Rather than having dialogue for the first three options, it is just an action that you perform with a chance of succession. For example, let's say you want to chat. Instead of any dialogue popping up, which feels natural, you gain affection points if the chat is successful. Have you, this is an immediate process as soon as you click the option. It just feels like the romancing/social building aspect was shoehorned in to make the game seem more desirable. You don't get any real personality from the characters other than Tavern Owner LOVES to drink, Scientist is a Nerd, Carpenter LOVES Wood, Plant Lady loves grass....etc. You don't actually get to interact with the people in this game. You just click buttons to farm points with them.<br><br>Even after giving your lovely, special character of choice a moonstone bracelet, that is it. That is all that happens. Ever. There is no point in dating.<br><br><u>Farming</u><br>The animations take forever and you spend more than half the day on your farm if you need to harvest/plant. Crops do not sell for much unless you choose to make a massive farm and spend your ENTIRE day farming. Options like fishing take up much less stamina and ends up being more lucrative. Upgrading tools make things easier but when you have the maxed out version, it still, for some reason, takes multiple hits to harvest something. For example, a small rock normally takes 4 hits with the standard hammer, 3 hits with the copper hammer, 2 hits with the iron hammer, and 2 hits with the moonstone hammer..... The fact that moonstones are also quite rare, makes this frustrating. While I haven't upgraded to a moonstone scythe, I believe it still also takes multiple swings to harvest crop seeds with it where it should only be....1 swing.<br><br><u>Combat</u><br>All in all, this feels okay. I do not have any qualms. To be fair, I barely have engaged in much of it since I have spent most of my time farming and really unable to have any time to do much else? <br><br><u>Skill Tree</u><br>The game, for whatever reason, loves to lock recipes behind feats. It does not makes sense. The fact that you also have to put points in your medallion in order to tame low level spirits is....another block in the road for most people. <br><br><u> Character Customization </u><br>Oddly enough, there is none. There will never be and this is....so dividing for many. You don't even get to give yourself a name.<br><br>There are many QoL issues that you'll notice as soon as you get into the game.<br>- Not being able to sell stacks at shops, you have to individually sell every item.<br>- Trees, rocks, and grass (all essential resources) are limited and NONRENEWABLE. Once you chop a tree, smash a rock, and cut some grass, they are gone forever.<br>- Mines that are uncovered, and once fully cleared out, remain a gaping hole despite having nothing in it. There is no way to cover up these mines and there are a limited number of mines throughout the map.<br>- Having to individually load furnaces rather than putting your stacks in and coming back when they are all done...... Also 3 iron ores making 1 iron ingot is crazy.....especially when each island has 1 mine and materials are non renewable.<br><br><br>There is many more issues that tons of people in the official discord bring up. But the sheer number of issues makes me feel like this game should have absolutely been early access and not fully launched.<br><br>Do not buy this game right now. The whole game needs a rework.<br><br><br>THAT ALL SAID!!!!<br><br>I loved all the ideas Moonstone Island brought to the table. It just feels like I'm drinking a la croix....It's like I'm trying to play a game but the game is in the other room. It's not quite there. Hopefully with future updates, it'll be MUCH better and fleshed out. But as of right now, it is not quite there.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"bb_h1\"> Collect, farm, explore, repeat.</div><br>Edit: 11/15— My issues with frame stuttering and streamlining the purchasing and crafting processes with a single click have since been fixed with patches.<br><br>Wow. Raw Fury has been knocking it out of the park with its recently published indie games.<br><br>Moonstone Island features two of my very favourite things to do: maintain a farmstead and battle monsters. Wait, make that four things, because I also enjoy collecting monsters and card game mechanics. Crap, no, five things: there are also dating sim elements where you can woo a sweetheart. There's just a lot to love here—and a lot of love put into the game by the small but mighty development team.<br><br>If you're sold on any of those features, buy this. $19.99 is a steal as you'll definitely get your money's worth. I'm eleven hours in and only through my first season with about a tenth of the islands fully explored and half of the spirits discovered. I'm playing on Steam Deck and it works right out the box, by the way. I was honestly prepared to pay more than that when the release date was finalized. If you're still on the fence, here's a bit more information:<br><br>You play as an unnamed apprentice alchemist (and no, it's not possible to customize your appearance) whose current task is to spend a year away from home. After a crash landing, you settle down on the titular Moonstone Island where you exist amongst the townspeople as the resident alchemist. You'll start from scratch, laying down a tent as your home base that can later be upgraded to a full blown house, and spend your time exploring numerous islands, befriending spirits and villagers, and living off the land.<br><br>The spirits you can tame fall into 1 of 8 types: earth, water, electric, fire, poison, ice, psychic, and dark. There are type advantages in play and you'll need to wittle down enemy armour before you can do any real damage to HP. Battles are done via turn based battles where you use cards to perform attacks. Each card requires a specific amount of energy to use and that energy is shared between all combatants, so you'll have to plan carefully to maximize your turns. When you level up your spirits, you're able to add a new card to your deck as well as invest a point in one of four stats that affects how much shield damage they do, how much health they have, the size of their own shield, and how much damage attacks do to health. This means no two monsters are the same, depending on how the points are dispersed, and it also means you can focus on what your current team setup needs.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Great</div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> Gorgeous pixel art.<br> </li><li> Exploration. The game boasts 100 islands to explore with some 30 dungeons to conquer. This should keep you busy for a long while. <br> </li><li> Clear Progression. You start with a tent and a balloon to travel from island to island, and build yourself up to a house and a glider (which, holy crap, totally changes inter-island travel). As you continue do to the things, your character unlocks skills in different categories to make farming, taming, and shmoozing with natives easier. There's also this parallel story with this mysterious stranger who has literally lost their mind that has you trekking far and wide to conquer elemental temples with increasing difficulty.<br> </li><li> Inclusivity. The dating pool is pretty varied and everyone has their own pronouns. The latter isn't something that I actively seek, but I know it will be important to others, so shout-out to the development team for that. P.S. Ferra is the cutest.<br> </li><li> Customization. You can decorate your home(s) at will and even chose where you'll set down roots. There are a lot of decorative options to unlock through dungeon diving and finding recipes and you can even design your own flooring and wallpapers once you unlock the Loom.</li></ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The Okay</div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>The music. The music is hit or miss: There are long stretches of silence and moments when the music is playing, but you don't really make note. Battle music also doesn't seem particularly battle worthy, just another chill track in a chill game.<br></li><li> Attack animations. A majority of the moves your spirits can use, even the high damage ones, look the same. This is a missed opportunity considering how nice everything else looks. <br></li><li> Spirits don't evolve or change in any way physically after you've tamed or hatched them. This will be a non-issue for some, but it would have been something to work towards, personally. </li></ul><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">The In Need of Improvement </div><br><i>What a dev team! My issues as listed below have been since addressed.</i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Furnaces. Furnaces should automatically start working after you close out their input menu and you should be able to automatically move over 3 ingredients since they can't work without that many, rather than have the user click once for each addition. The same goes for purchasing from the general shop. It's just a lot of clicking that can be streamlined for a better user experience.<br></li><li>On Steam Deck, at least, the frame rate drops every so often when running around on Moonstone Island. It's nothing game breaking, but it's definitely noticeable. I'm not sure what causes this, but hopefully it's addressed in future patches.</li></ul><br>Thanks for reading &lt;3\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPlaying this game makes me wonder if the devs have even played this game (or any games for that matter) <br><br>Everything is tedious;<br><br>- Want to smelt ore you've mine into ingots? Well you can only make one ingot at a time per furnace...so make 20 different furnaces so you can mass process ore. You can't drag a stack of coal or ore into the furnace so you'll have to individually click each singular piece of coal and ore into it. lovely.<br><br>- Farming crops.<br> So there are seasons and different crops for each season. Winter crops can't be planted in winter...they can't be planted in any other season except winter. So how do you plant them then? Well you'll need a greenhouse; a building you can craft. Seems fine right? You can even craft more than one so you could have multiple, if you wanted to spend the crafting resources (some quite tedious to obtain) on building more than one. Well, every greenhouse shares the exact same interior, so no matter how many you build you will never have more internal space in greenhouses. If you built 100, which ever one you enter, you will always end up in the same one, with the same crops growing. If you want a greenhouse for spring crops, a different greenhouse for summer crops, a different one for autumn and a different one for winter, you can't do that. Also, once crafted, objects can't be dismantled which means you just waste resources and the time it took you to get them. <br>You don't even get that much space in a greenhouse. When fully upgraded a greenhouse will have 8 3x3 spaces to grow crops which is 72 in total, if you're using sprinklers that'll reduce the number to 64. For a fully upgraded building this is such a small amount considering the resource cost to craft the greenhouse in the first place and then to upgrade it fully. This small amount of space is the main reason you would want more than one greenhouse.<br>Also some plants are re-harvest-able, which basically means when you harvest the crop it replants itself automatically. This makes non re-harvest-able crops more tedious to grow in comparison, to the point where you may as well not bother planting them in the first place.<br><br>- Tool upgrades. <br> So there's 3 tiers to tool upgrades; Copper, Iron and Moonstone. <br>Upgrading the Axe and Hammer makes it so you have to hit trees and stones one less time per upgrade to break them, doesn't reduce energy use per swing however. <br>Upgrading the hoe and watering can increase the amount of tiles hit when used but both of these seem worthless to upgrade as tilled soil doesn't disappear even if not watered or planted on. The watering can is quickly made redundant by sprinklers, which are cheaper to craft in bulk than to upgrade the watering can. Also you don't have to spend time watering things manually.<br>Upgrading the Scythe is only useful to collect seeds, as some seeds can only be harvested with an upgraded scythe (unless you've unlocked the skill point that gives crops a 50% chance to drop seeds when harvested). When the season changes, if you had any crops growing outside, they will be replace with a dead plant which can only be removed using a scythe. Upgrading the scythe doesn't increase the AOE of it's swing so you have to hit every dead plant individually to get rid of them. fun.<br><br>There's so many other problems like the levelling experience, friendship with npcs decaying, psychic storms (or what ever they're called) being a ball ache to find and how it won't be marked on your map unless you're close enough to it, but if you're close to it you don't need it marked on you map because you know where it is, it should be marked on your map when it becomes nighttime irregardless of where you are in relation to it so you can fly over there if you want to instead of just flying around aimlessly hoping to get lucky before your character passes out from staying up too late at night.<br><br>I could write more but quite frankly I cant be bothered. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't waste your money or time on this game.<br><br>Edit: I've found some other problems with this game...<br>There are these things called Spirits (basically like Pokemon but less interesting) they have different types; water, fire etc. They also have abilities and instead of moves they have a deck of cards which you can add a new card to when they level up. Of all the different Spirits in this game the only real differences between them are their appearance and their ability. There don't seem to be any cards unique to any of the Spirits you can tame. So you really just tame them for how they look or if they have a useful ability.<br>Out of all the different types of Spirit in the game the best is Psychic. The reason for this is that Psychic types can get cards that give you +1 or + 2 energy and double or triple the amount of energy you currently have. You can very easily get to the energy cap of 99 in every battle. They also have access to a card called &quot;Momentum&quot; this cards effect is basically &quot;when you play a card draw a card&quot; couple this with 99 energy and the fact that when you run out of cards in you deck to draw you shuffle your discard pile in to you deck...so if you have a small deck you can consistently have infinite cards and infinite energy to play them with. not the best balance.<br><br>Also when you level up a Spirit you can increase one of its stats; Vitality (increases its health), Speed (Increases the strength of &quot;Bash&quot; cards and determines who goes first in battle), Armour (reduces damage taken from attacks) and Power (determines how much damage their attacks do). I want to focus on Speed, specifically the part that determines who goes first in battle. This doesn't work at all. You can have a team of up to 3 Spirits at a time. In my team I have a level 41 with 36 speed, a level 41 with 18 speed and a level 40 with 20 speed that's a total of 74 speed combine. This exact team has been out-sped by single digit level Spirits with single digit speed stats. Literally level 7 Spirits with 5-8 speed out-speeding my team. wtf.<br><br>You can't buy items in bulk. They have to be brought individually. Which means if you want to buy more that one item you have to click more than once (and no you can't hold the button to purchase multiple of the same thing, I've tried). Again this, like many things in this game, is very tedious. if you want to buy 100 of an item you'll need to click it 100 times. you know instead of just typing a number in a text box or shift clicking to buy 10 at a time or ctrl clicking to buy 25 at a time.<br><br>I suppose a game cannot be made with mechanics or systems more intelligent then those who design or code it.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWith about 50 hours on record, I can definitively say that this game is a decent game, but has too many problems. Let me go over some of the extremely bad bugs I experienced in the first week of playing this game.<br>- The game crashed. Not just once, not just twice, but I counted a total of 19 crashes. No, my computer is not bad. Sometimes when screen transitioning it will just crash and you'll loose all your progress if you don't religiously save.<br>- I lost all my inventory on multiple occasions. This is a massive problem as all I could do was reload or sacrifice everything I had.<br>- The walking house generally doesn't always work to stay on its path. It will just go off the side of the map sometimes.<br>- A notification appeared in the greenhouse saying the plants wouldn't grow in season, despite being seasonless.<br>- You could duplicate all spirits by just taming the main one and running, including rare ones.<br><br>It's a real big shame. These will probably get patched over time, yes, but what isn't as fixable is the gameplay.<br>- Of the different types of spirits, the balancing severely favors certain types. Not only that, some can deal 1 million damage on turn one, while others barely survive a single hit.<br>- Experience gain is ABYSMAL. Your options are to plant crops and spam them to increase experience or just tame new spirits. You can't reasonably level anything.<br>- The relationships aren't really to the level of Stardew Valley, and it feels that way when you become serious with someone. It ends up feeling pretty hollow, and talking to someone feels like a task.<br>- The dungeons are extremely bland. They all look fairly similar, and there are several that are just &quot;Banish all the spirits to win!&quot;<br><br>To be honest, my opinion leads to be a roughly 7/10 game. Not a bad thing, but because of the bugs really, really making me waste a total of 5+ hours of real life time due to crashes and inventory losses, it's hard to reccomend it in its current state. The developers just needed a bit more Q&amp;A, and the game could've easily hit the 8-9/10 range. If this game gets good updates in the future, I will switch to reccomending and adjust my review, but currently it's not the best game.\t\t\t\t\t<div

Randomly generated map increases the uniqueness of each playthrough, and since the deck system is quite varied, it is really fun to to try playing around with different team comps on new runs. Overall, it is a very enjoyable chill game. <br><br>That being said, the farming aspect has less depth compared to other farming games, similar to how Rune Factory is compared to Story of Seasons. I think it would benefits greatly from if it has good modding support to bring more QoL and fine-tune to each individual enjoyment\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMoonstone Island has made me come to realise I am a sucker for games of this genre. I don't typically write serious reviews as most of mine are nonsensical, but this time I feel different. The game itself is like a mix of Stardew Valley and Pokemon, and this is strongly reflected in both gameplay and music, and I love it. The sprite work is colourful and eye catching and the game itself plays well. However, the game does have its flaws (I will mention these in the Cons section), but these flaws don't inherently take away from the fun of the game, not to a significant extent that is.<br><br><br>Here are a list of some of my Pros and Cons with the game, as far as my experience goes:<br><br><br>PROS:<br><br>- The characters are charming, each with their own personalities, likes and dislikes, needless to say there will be at least ONE character you will strive to like.<br><br>- There's always something to do! Farming, mining, fishing, interacting with villagers, exploring new islands, upgrading your house... The game has a ton on offer to keep you occupied.<br><br>- Music is pleasant and likeable. As mentioned, if you have played Pokemon you'll understand what I mean when I say it will remind you of the games!<br><br>- While the combat isn't overly complex and fairly simple, It's a change of pace for those looking to distance away from other tasks such as farming in order to focus more on spirits. However, I would recommend enabling fast mode during combat as it can get slow and boring pretty quickly without this feature enabled.<br><br><br>CONS:<br><br>- My biggest gripe is the BUGS. While there aren't many, there are only a handful that have slight affected my experience while playing. One bug in particular completely prevents the menu from being opened, whether this be the pause menu, tool wheel or crafting menu. The only fix for this is to enter a loading zone (house, dungeon, mine or encounter a spirit). The bug occurs when you open and close the menu too fast (as far as I'm aware). Not sure if this has happened for anyone else, but I've read articles and I don't believe I'm the only one who has experienced this issue.<br><br>- Adding on to above, occasionally the game will soft lock as a result of this bug. If you try to open the menu in the bugged state, (sometimes) it will open but not display the menu. This can result in the player not being able to close the menu, resulting in a softlock.<br><br>- Another bug I ran into was a soft lock while picking a card during combat, while this only happened ONCE, it may have been due to me selecting a card too fast? I wouldn't worry too much about this one.<br><br><br>Ultimately, Moonstone Island is a GOOD game. Don't let the minor bugs deter you from the game itself. As far as my experience goes, if you like Stardew Valley, you'll have a fun time with this game. The game offers plenty to do, mind you I only have 9 hours on the game and I still have WAY more to uncover and explore. For a small Dev team they've definitely created something with tons of potential, I am excited to see what becomes of this game in the future!\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game has great music, cute graphics, overall has just been a delight. The battling, monster collecting, and deck building mechanics are all very fun to interact with. Traveling around from island to island, digging up treasure, mining, dungeon diving and getting to know the large world map feels very fulfilling. <br><br>I'd like to give a second shout out to the great sound design. Music makes or breaks games, and this one has a soundtrack that makes it very easy to lose yourself in this big little world. Secondary sound designs are on point too. Picking up materials has a very satisfying noise, activating your magic broom, etc.<br><br>I've only completed the first season and a half, so I haven't seen everything the game has to offer yet. That being said, I have two minor complaints so far:<br><br>The first is that though the mechanics of combat are fun, and the design of the monsters are cute and interesting, the attacks lack graphical pizzazz. Many attacks have lackluster animations (Avalanche is a 3-energy attack that is very fun to use as a finisher, and it's especially underwhelming), and there's no extra dopamine fix like a screen shake or achievement if you deal massive amounts of damage (or maybe there is, and I just haven't gotten my numbers high enough yet). <br><br>The second complaint I have is that I love all these villagers so much. I really wish I could see more of them, maybe celebrate some holidays with them. Like I mentioned earlier, I've only played through spring and half of summer, but so far the only things to celebrate with them have been birthdays and dates. I love their designs. I've gotten one character to maximum hearts, and didn't get any extra scenes with her yet. Though it's been really fun doing other side quests for the villagers.<br><br>I'm having lots of fun with this game. I know there's more left for me to find.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMoonstone Island is game that makes me wish Steam had a &quot;Neutral&quot; rating option for review. But since the question is, &quot;Would you recommend this game?&quot; my current answer for Moonstone Island is a solid no at this current time which leads to my choice of giving the game a negative review.<br><br>So now to answer the question of why I wouldn't recommend the game.<br><br>I would describe Moonstone Island as very ambitious. Studio Supersoft clearly tried to include many different ideas into Moonstone Island but like with most Jack-of-All-Trades approaches they have failed to really find mastery with any particular element in their game.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h3\">Life-Sim </div>- The villagers aren't unlikable but they don't often really feel alive. It feels like a solid starting point for a game in this genre but doesn't execute past being the bare minimum most of the time. The date mechanic is nice and helps flesh out your chosen romantic partner's character. Some villagers are very forgettable like Cleo who I had to look up their name as part of writing this review.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h3\"> Creature Collector </div>- Probably Moonstone Island's most fleshed out axis of gameplay. That being said &quot;Creature Collector&quot; is the wrong way to describe Moonstone Island. This game is fundamentally a deck builder. Do not go into this game expecting to catch &quot;Pokemon&quot; and each Pokemon feel like it's own individual unique entity. Each &quot;Spirit&quot; (This game's equivalent to a pokemon) has a deck of cards that they represent and when you are in battle with other spirits you draw from a combined deck of cards for each spirit you have active on your team, up to 3 spirits. There are only 3 things that make each spirit truly unique from other spirits; it's passive, it's type and it's weaknesses to cards of other types. The issue here is that most of the passives are inconsequential with eachother and, as far as I can tell, no spirit has any cards that are unique to that spirit. By this I mean, if you have an Earth type spirit, it has access to all the same cards as EVERY other earth type spirit, which makes all earth type spirit feel almost entirely the same outside of their appearance and passive. Moonstone island also somewhat punishes player for actively collecting spirits  due to the fact that unless you spend the tedious time to feed your excess collected spirits every day they will run away. There is an expensive recipe that you unlock early into the game that does ultimately remove that tax but it feels antithetical to a &quot;Creature Collector&quot; game to punish players for collecting creatures.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h3\"> Exploration </div>- One of the other pillars of the game play loop in Moonstone Island that helps differentiate it from other farm-sim titles is Exploration. This feels relatively fresh for the first 5 hours of game play but eventually the vignette falls and the realization will set in that aside from their shape every island in the game is the same except for the biome they represent out of the 4-5 different types of biomes. That is unless have a randomly assigned dungeon on them.<br>- Dungeons are just fine. They reward the player's exploration efforts with small amount loot but the main draw being a permanent stamina upgrade. I wish dungeons were more visually distinct from each other based on the biome that they are located in, it's mildly nonsensical to have to cross a river of magma in order to access a dungeon on a fire island only to be greeted by a grassy stone ruin once you enter it.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h3\"> Farm-Sim </div>- Moonstone Island's farming is just kinda <i> there </i>. It's a feature that feels like it exists because there is an expectation for it for the genre but it really doesn't add much to the game play loop outside of generating income for the player or getting food buffs to feed your spirits. The clunky controls also contribute to it feeling like an under developed system. I feel like the devs recognized this because you start the game with access to sprinklers which automate that majority of effort required to farm in the game. There are some crops in the late game that give a lot of EXP to your spirits when you feed them but that feels more like an answer to the frustratingly low amount of EXP you get from actually battling other spirits.<br><br><div class=\"bb_h3\"> Miscellaneous </div>- The UX in this game is passable most of the time but occasionally is atrocious. You will run into this the most with the inventory management and any attempt to do larger scale farming efforts. Want to plant a large field of crops? Enjoy spamming right-click/space hundreds of times to buy each seed individually since there is no bulk purchasing option. Want to quickly move a stack of items into a chest? You have to drag and drop it, right clicking only puts in 1 at a time but thankfully you can hold down right click in this rare instance. <br>- Fishing exists in this game but it feels like it's been tacked on solely due to genre expectations. <br>- There are character level-up RPG-like elements in the game that really don't need to exist. Very few of the passives feel like anything other than a small incremental numbers boost and some exist just to slow down the game play loop. You cannot tame higher level spirits that you encounter in the wild until you unlock certain passives that let you tame those higher level spirits. <br>- Progressing through the temples (the game's equivalent to a story/campaign/gyms) is blocked by progressing through the seasons. This forces the player to not rush through the game but in turn forces the player to pay attention to all of the other mediocre game play &amp; game design. You'll eventually run out of things that feel worthwhile to do in the game so that the only way to feel like you are progressing is to sleep until the next season so that you can continue to progress the game.<br>- The game occasionally really chugs when exploring certain islands. <br>- I've had the occasional bug that would black screen the game and  force me to close out the game and lose some progress in order to resolve the issue.<br><br>Moonstone Island feels like an early access game that had it's full release come preemptively. I suspect that with another year or two of development Studio Supersoft can make Moonstone Island a standout from other similar indie titles but currently just feels like it's trying to be nothing more than barely adequate to answer it's initial moonshot ambitions.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI can't really put my thumb on it, but this game kinda just left me wanting. <br><br><b> Pros </b> <br>- Game actually makes you feel rewarded for completing content. Opening chests has that diablo loot shower feel. It isn't anywhere close but it gives the same vibe<br>- You can basically put your farm anywhere. Find a nice island you like? Capitalism baby, bulldoze and move in! *Bulldozer not an actual feature<br>- Game doesn't really make you suffer for upgrading. For example farming, the watering can gets very quickly replaced with sprinklers and you can kinda just not care about that. Which is really good in my book, might not be for others.<br>- This is more of a personal pro, but there is a lack of information, so discovering things does feel natural and not told by wiki. This can be a con for others.<br><br><br><b> Cons </b> <br>- Story kinda just goes. Feel like it needs a bit more meat before you are in your town. <br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> You kinda just fall into a town, literally and suddenly you were the person everyone was expecting. </span></span> <br>- No evolutions for the monsters you can capture. Honestly it just feels bad, not even for your starter. I've read that it wasn't planned for release, but this was after searching for it. What you see is what you get and it's kinda disappointing.<br>- Bugs and no the monster type. One big one is when you go to sell something, the price just doesn't work. I sell a ingot and I got 200 but the sell price at the vendor showed 375, then 300, then 200. It's all over the place.<br>- Card battling system: Honestly it just feels bad. Where there are standards out there like slay the spire, this just doesn't even come close. Like I get what they are going for, but if you haven't sunk hours into something like slay the spire, you're not gonna know how to build a deck for combat and it's just gonna be an awful time. I wouldn't expect the average person to have that knowledge.<br>- Lack of Carrot: I really just didn't feel like I had anything to chase. There is shiny versions of the monsters and I got lucky to get one, but just didn't feel the same. Atleast to me<br><br>Overall, game just makes me feel like I gotta wait for another 2 years for it to be feature complete. Kinda wish the steam window for refunds wasn't just 2 hours, I'd request my money back and buy again when they flesh the game out. As of right now it doesn't feel like a 1.0 release game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a
